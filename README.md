# Description
In this project, there are some captchas in [samples] folder and a neural network model is used to predict new captchas.(You can see more detail in [Report.html])

## Installation
In the folder you should run this commands on [cmd] in the folder of the project:
```
python Captcha_Recognization.py
```
In the running process, first you can see a converted sample figure after preprocessing.
Then, after printing some information and fitting data(estimated 2-3 minutes), you can see model loss figure.
At last, a file named [result.csv] has been created that shows the predicted values and true values in csv form for test data.
